# ADA Project
## Abstract
The goal of this project is to create a temporal profile of the social and cultural trends of the city over the years using georeferenced social media data. 
## Data Description
The analysis will be performed on Flickr data that could be either found online (Flickr image relationships https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-flickr.html) or obtained using Flickr API. The idea is to use the metadata of images (tags, location, group, etc.) to infer certain trend in certain city. The metadata should be first grouped 
## Risks/Feasibility
Broad topic, Flickr data might not give enough information to prove/reject some hypothesis. 
## Deliverables
## Timeplan
